# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# users = User.create(first_name:"Mark", last_name:"Lehn", email:"marklehn@icloud.com", password_digest:"asdfasdf", phone_number:"6511231233", agent:true)
#
# properties = Property.create(
# [{ address: "123 6th St. Melbourne, FL", bedrooms: 2, bathrooms: 3, zipcode: 32904, user: 1, sq_ft: 300, rent: true},
# { address: "71 Pilgrim Avenue
# Chevy Chase, MD", bedrooms: 2, bathrooms: 1, zipcode: 20815, user: 1, sq_ft: 400, rent: true}])
